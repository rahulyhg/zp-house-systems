ZodiacPress House Systems
=========================

This adds the option to set a desired house system for the ZodiacPress Birth Report. Also lets you add House Comparisons to the Birth Report to compare birth planets in multiple house systems.

For regular use, download the plugin [from Cosmic Plugsin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/zodiacpress/) since the versions/releases of ZP House Systems here on GitHub are development versions which aren't intended to be used on live sites.

Pull requests and Issues are welcome.
